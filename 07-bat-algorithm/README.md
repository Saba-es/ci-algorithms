## Travelling Salesman Problem Using Bat Algorithm
(Using Bat Algorithm (meta heuristic) to find an optimal solution for Travelling Salesman Problem)

The project generally asks the user to enter cities first and it creates a matrix using the numbers that then user entered. Then it calculates the random paths and the cost of each path and acquires frequencies and calculates the best solutions and cost. Then it chooses the best way with least cost.
